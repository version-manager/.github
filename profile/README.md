# version-manager

To see compatibility and features across version managers (and meta-version managers), see the [documents](https://github.com/version-manager/documents) repository.

This organization also holds [woof](https://github.com/version-manager/woof), a meta-version manager of my own, written in Bash. It also includes the following plugins:

- [woof-plugin-hashicorp](https://github.com/version-manager/woof-plugin-hashicorp)
- [woof-plugin-ancillary](https://github.com/version-manager/woof-plugin-ancillary)
- [woof-plugin-core](https://github.com/version-manager/woof-plugin-core)
