# Contributing Guide

Be nice and respect the maintainers' time. ðŸ˜„

## Contribute

Contributions aren't exclusively code, and can also include:

- Fixing typos
- Improving documentation
- Sharing your opinion _constructively_

## Issues

- If there is an issue template, please fill it out.
- I will likely close issues that are low-effort
- Avoid duplicating issues by searching for an existing equivalent before you open a new one
- Don't needlessly _bump_ issues. Like seriously, _don't_.

## Pull Requests

- If the changes are large or breaking, please open an issue first
- Don't perform unrelated changes
- Adhere to the existing code style
- Please double-check your changes
- You must make PRs from a branch that's different than the default one
